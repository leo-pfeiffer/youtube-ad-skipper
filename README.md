# youtube-ad-skipper
YouTube ad skipper plugin for Tampermonkey / UserScript

The script skips all ads on YouTube once they show up except for ads that are 5 or less seconds long (I'm working on that).

## Getting started

Install the [Tampermonkey Browser Extension for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/tampermonkey/dhdgffkkebhmkfjojejmpbldmpobfkfo?hl=en), and add `script.js` as a new script.

Whenever you are on youtube, the script will run in the background and do it's job.
